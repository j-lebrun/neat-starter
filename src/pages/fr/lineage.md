The Birankai is the school founded by T.K. Chiba Shihan. Birankai International
represents the culmination of a long-held wish of Chiba Sensei. He has long desired
that his students, who are scattered across the globe, should have a single organization
to support their training.

The role of Shihans (highest teaching certification) pupils of Chiba Sensei is :

- To establish good communication between themselves and the general members.
- To strengthen the connection between continental Europe, the UK, and the US.
- To maintain the clear, high standards that Sensei has developed for teachers.
- To stimulate the growth of the art by providing strong support for the teacher-student relationship.

Birankai is recognized by Hombu Dojo.
